# Live Unit Display

This is a program written in C. It converts Units like cm, mm, m, and km (understand those acronyms... Idiot).

CM - Centimeters
KM - Kilometers
M - Meters
MM - Millimeters

Those are the units that the programs support; you can also add your own ones if you want to.

# I'M DEAD SERIOUS
I used Google Gemini to help me with the maths in this code. I am no mathematician; therefore, there is no way I am studying for shit like this.
Why did I do this? **BECAUSE I HATE MY LIFE.**

I command you to enjoy your day.

This is a Public Archive and can be used for educational purposes. But as I said, most of the maths was done by AI, not me.

Oh, and also this already has an .exe file ready for use, so you don't have to compile the code yourself.
